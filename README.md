# ESMDR-prediction
The Efficient Survival Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (ESMDR) method is a computationally efficient algorithm to detect genome-wide genetic interactions with an ability to adjust for covariates. Identifying single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) interactions at the genome-wide scale is limited due to computational and statistical challenges. We address the computational burden encountered when detecting SNP interactions for survival analysis, such as age of disease-onset, by developing a novel algorithm that uses Martingale Residuals as the outcome parameter for rapid processing of time and event status with genotyope data for survival outcome estimation.
